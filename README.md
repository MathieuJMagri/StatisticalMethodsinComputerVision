# StatisticalMethodsinComputerVision
Final Project for ECSE 626.

From course syllabus:

"""

In this course, we explore the conjecture that the world is uncertain and therefore should
be described through the language of probabilities. We will describe several standard
problems in computer vision and explore probabilistic inference methods for their
solution.

This course is designed for graduate students pursuing interests in the areas of computer
vision, medical image analysis and artificial intelligence (e.g. machine learning).

The course will describe a wide variety of difficult and open problems in computer
vision. These include (but are not limited to): stereo vision, motion estimation, object
recognition, face detection and classification, image registration and alignment, and
image segmentation. We will explore probabilistic solutions to these problems by
studying a variety of subjects such as the following:

- Standard regularization and Bayesian regularization approaches to solving ill-posed vision problems
- Probabilistic inference, Bayesian inference
- Information theory (e.g. Mutual information, Entropy)
- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Expectation Maximization (EM)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and eigenmodels, Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
- Markov Random Field (MRF) models, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)
- Deep learning: Generative Models (e.g. VAEs), Bayesian Deep Learning, and others
